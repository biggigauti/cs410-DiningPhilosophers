# cs410-DiningPhilosophers
This is the final lab of CS-410 Operating Systems. Dining Philosophers is a classic sychronization problem that allows programers to properly handle concurrency-control problems. There is a shared resource among multiple threads. Our solution is not entirely original, as we wrote 80% of the code provided, however, it executes in a starvation-free manner.
